# Stack (abstract data type)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

This article is about the abstract concept. For some concrete uses of the term in computing, see Stack (disambiguation) ยง Computing.

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with two main operations:

- Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
- Pop, which removes the most recently added element.

Additionally, a peek operation can, without modifying the stack, return the value of the last element added. The name stack is an analogy to a set of physical items stacked one atop another, such as a stack of plates.
