# Breadcrumb Types

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

There are three types of web breadcrumbs:

- Location: location breadcrumbs are static and show where the page is located in the website hierarchy.
- Attribute: attribute breadcrumbs give information that categorizes the current page.
- Path: path breadcrumbs show users the steps they took to end up on current page.
