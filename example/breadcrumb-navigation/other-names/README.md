# Other Names for Breadcrumb Navigation

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Some commentators and programmers alternatively use the term "cookie crumb" as a synonym to describe the navigation design. This is not the same thing as HTTP cookies (text files websites write on a visitor's machine that record data such as login information).

Michigan Community College's Virtual Learning Collaborative uses the term "Navigation Path", as do some Drupal users.

French and Spanish speakers sometimes use instead the term [Ariadne's thread](breadcrumb-navigation/other-names/ariadne's-thread.md) (in French fil d'Ariane) in relation to the thread left by Ariadne to Theseus so he can find the exit of the labyrinth after killing the Minotaur, on a [LIFO](breadcrumb-navigation/other-names/fifo) (stack) instead of FIFO (queue) way.
